# Number Guessing Game

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Dev_Element_PP/pen/ExrmxXo](https://codepen.io/Dev_Element_PP/pen/ExrmxXo).

This pen allows you to use all your favourite console functions right in CodePen: `console.log`, `console.info`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, and `console.clear` are supported.

To scroll the console to the bottom as messages are printed use the `console.follow` function.

Fork this pen to quickly create a new pen which is pre-configured for JavaScript console output.
